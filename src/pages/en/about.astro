          My name is Caio Leta. I am a Bitcoin researcher, content strategist, and geologist by training,
          with a PhD from the University of São Paulo (USP). I work at the intersection of Bitcoin, energy,
          and education, translating complex technical concepts into accessible ideas.
        </p>

        <p>
          I believe that the energy revolution Bitcoin represents is as important as the monetary revolution
          it enables. This conviction guides my work and content production.
        </p>

        <h2>Background</h2>

        <p>
          My academic career was in Geology, with a master's and doctoral degree focused on Isotope Geology
          and Geochronology applied to mineral deposit formation. I conducted research in international settings,
          collaborating with teams from Colombia, Spain, and Canada, including a period as a visiting researcher
          at Memorial University of Newfoundland.
        </p>

        <p>
          In recent years, I transitioned to the Bitcoin ecosystem. At Arthur Mining (now Arthur Inc.),
          I served as Head of Research, producing monthly technical reports for clients and investors
          on mining operations and the integration between bitcoin mining and stranded energy.
        </p>

        <p>
          At Bipa, a Brazilian bitcoin-only exchange, I was Head of Content and Research. I built the
          platform's educational narrative, managed blog and social media, and launched the Bipa Podcast,
          which became one of the largest bitcoin-only podcasts in Brazil between 2024-2025.
        </p>

        <p>
          In partnership with Brasil Paralelo, Brazil's largest independent education platform, I created
          and taught the Bitcoin Mining module for the platform's official Bitcoin Certification.
        </p>

        <h2>Explica Bitcoin</h2>

        <p>
          I founded Explica Bitcoin, one of the leading educational projects about Bitcoin in Brazil.
          The project includes over 100 articles translated from English to Portuguese (before AI
          made this work easier), over 20 original texts, and more than 100 podcast episodes.
        </p>

        <h2>Book</h2>

        <p>
          To celebrate my first year studying Bitcoin, I wrote a book titled
          "O Mundo Mágico do Bitcoin" (The Magical World of Bitcoin), a compilation of my initial studies on the subject.
        </p>

        <h2>Education</h2>

        <p>
          PhD in Geosciences (Isotope Geology and Geochronology) from USP. Master's and bachelor's degrees
          in Geology, also from USP. Fluent in Portuguese, English, and advanced Spanish.
